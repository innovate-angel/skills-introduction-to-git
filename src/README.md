# Stack Overflown

Organize the falling blocks into the current debug pattern before the stack overflows! ⏳

## How to Play

- **←/→** Move the falling block left or right
- **↑** Rotate the block
- **↓** Soft drop (move down faster)
- **Space** Hard drop (instantly drop)
- **P** Pause the game

Match the target error pattern shown on the right before the stack reaches the top!

## How to Develop

- `index.html` - the game container for playing
- `index.js` - the primary game logic
- `patterns.js` - the error patterns to match during gameplay
- `style.css` - the game formatting and styling
